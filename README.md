# Ancestry-Power-User Browser Extension

The project is the source for a browser extension to assist Ancestry.com power users by saving them work and time.

## Number of people on the search result page

A button is provided for you to click and get a count of the number of the people in the current search page results.

## Scroll to the bottom of search results

Since the search results page continuously loads more records when you scroll to the bottom, a button is provided to assist you by automatically scrolling every few seconds for the number of times you specify. Eventually, the page will stop loading new records and you'll know you've loaded all the search results into the current page.

## Automatically adding search results to an existing group

After you've entered search criteria in the normal way and then scrolled to the bottom with no new records loading, you may want to add all of the records on the current page to a group. You need to create the group through the normal way and then specify the exact group name to this extension. Clicking the button to add people to your group may take a long time, so let it run.
