# Ancestry-Power-User Browser Extension

The project is the source for a browser extension to assist Ancestry.com power users by saving them work and time.

## Number of people on the search result page

A button is provided for you to click and get a count of the number of the people in the current search page results.

## Scroll to the bottom of search results

Since the search results page continuously loads more records when you scroll to the bottom, a button is provided to assist you by automatically scrolling every few seconds for the number of times you specify. Eventually, the page will stop loading new records and you'll know you've loaded all the search results into the current page.

## Automatically adding search results to an existing group

After you've entered search criteria in the normal way and then scrolled to the bottom with no new records loading, you may want to add all of the records on the current page to a group. You need to create the group through the normal way and then specify the exact group name to this extension. Clicking the button to add people to your group may take a long time, so let it run.


## Site walkthrough

After logging in to http://ancestry.com

Browse through the top menu by clicking on DNA -> Your DNA Results Summary. 

Switch to whatever Test you want, if you have multiple. 

Then click on the green View All DNA Matches button on the page. 

At the top of the list, click on the Groups button. Remember the exact name of a group you want to add people. Create a group, if you don't have any groups yet.

From you, you can start using the extension.

## Example Idea

Next to the Groups button, click the Shared DNA button.  Within the popup, enter a custom centimorgan range to filter your results. You can then add the specific results to an appropriately named group.

## Tips

- Although Ancestry.com does not seem to allow for entering decimals in the centimorgan fields, which would allow for searches like 6.00 to 6.99, you can copy/paste decimal values into the textboxes and the search will work. More specifically, open up Notepad and type 7.99, copy that number and paste it into the max centimorgan value textbox.
